    <p>Hi Anna, How are you? I hope you are enjoying your holiday in Spain. I miss you a lot. I have some news to tell you. Last week, I had a small accident at work. I was carrying some boxes and I dropped one on my finger. It hurt a lot and it turned purple. The doctor said it was not broken, but I have to wear a bandage for a few days. On the bright side, I bought some new sunglasses yesterday. They are very stylish and they match the colour of my hair. Do you like them? I attached a photo for you to see. How is your family? And how are your studies going? I know you are working hard to get your degree. I am very proud of you. Write back soon and tell me everything. Love, Tom</p>
    <p>Dear Tom,It's great to hear from you. I'm doing well and enjoying my holiday in Spain. Thank you for asking. I'm sorry to hear about your accident at work, but I'm glad to know that it wasn't serious. I hope your finger heals soon.I really like the new sunglasses you bought. They look great on you and the color matches your hair perfectly. Good choice! My family is doing well. My parents just celebrated their anniversary and they went on a trip to the mountains. As for my studies, they are going well. I have been working hard to keep up with the coursework, but it's been challenging. However, I'm determined to do my best and get my degree.Thanks for checking in and for being proud of me. It means a lot. I hope we can catch up soon.Take care,Anna</p>
